FreeRADIUS 2.2.8 Thursday 09 Jul 2015 11:00:00 EDT, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* None.

	Bug fixes
	* Fixes for clients tied to virtual servers.  If there is
	  no "listen" section there, clients use the main "listen"
	  section.
	* Remove compiler warnings
	* Print out correct filenames in debug mode
	* Allow post-auth section to return "reject".  This turns
	  the response into Access-Reject.
	* Set X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL, and add "check_all_crl"
	  to eap.conf.  Fixes oCert CVE-2015-4680.

FreeRADIUS 2.2.7 Wednesday 22 Apr 2015 14:00:00 EST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Allow "eap" to be listed in Post-Auth-Type Reject
	  so that it sends EAP-Fail and Message-Authenticator.

	Bug fixes
	* Fix typo in code checking for blocked threads.
	  Closes #880.
	* Added more $(EXEEXT) to module utilities so that it
	  builds on Cygwin.  Closes #875.

	  the group if one fails.
	* Fix potential read into uninitialised memory in rlm_pap
	  when normalising octet type attributes containing password
	  hashes. This is very unlikely to happen in the wild.
	* Don't stop decoding DHCP options if we find a padding
	  option.
	* Define sig_t on systems which don't have it.  Closes #765
	* When clients are loaded from SQL, allow them to be tied

	* A "panic_action" can be set to have the server dump a gdb
	  log on SEGV or other fatal error.
	* allow radmin command "set module status <module> <code>"
	  which can be used to forcibly enable/disable modules.

	Bug fixes
	* If the server fails to bind() after fork(), that is now
	  reported to the parent, which exits with an error.
	* Session / delay times in MySQL are unsigned int.
	* Use --tag=CC for libtool.  Closes #497.  Because libtool
	  is too stupid to notice that compiling means compilation.
	* Fix bug when copying attributes for vendors > 32767
	* Fix behaviour on FreeBSD where sending packets from an interface
	  bound to an IP address would fail when the server was built with
	  udpfromto.
	* Don't fail config check if were listening on an IP which is
	  also a home server. Some deployments have valid reasons
	  to loop packets back to another virtual server.
	* Use correct port when DHCP relaying.
	* Set source IP address for DHCP packets from DHCP-Server-IP-Address,
	  or DHCP-DHCP-Server-Identifier, if we're unable to otherwise
	  determine the source IP.

	* Use correct fields for X509 attributes in certificates
	* Install threads.h making it possible to link against the
	  installed headers again.
	* Initialize SSL once in "main", instead of rlm_eap_tls.
	  Some client libraries may need SSL.

FreeRADIUS 2.2.1 Tuesday 17 Sep 2013 12:00:00 CEST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Updated dictionaries for alcatel, broadsoft, bskyb, dlink, meru,
	  telkom, trapeze, proxim, zeus, rfc6677, 6911, and rfc6930.
	* Added %{randstr:..} support. Creates random strings in a
	  controllable format.
	* Added operator support to rlm_python
	* Added %{hex:...} for hex version of raw attribute data
	* Added %{sha1:...} for SHA1 hashing of data
	* Added %{base64:...} for raw attribute data (e.g. 32-bit IP addr),
	  and %{tobase64:...} for the printable string form (e.g. 1.2.3.4),
	  and %{base64tohex:...} to convert a base64 string to a hex string.
	* rlm_expr is now responsible for registering many of the xlat
	  expansions. This is cleaner than bundling them all in the server
	  core. You should ensure 'expr' is listed in instantiate to ensure
	  correct operation of xlat expansions.
	* Use correct terminology when printing errors regarding request/
	  response/message authenticators.
	* Added keytab support to Heimdal Kerberos. Patch from Ryan Steinmetz.
	* radsqlrelay does multiple INSERTs in one transaction.
	  Patch from Uwe Meyer-Gruhl.
	* Run Post-Proxy-Type Reject {} if the upstream server rejected the
	  request.
	* On startup, the server checks if it was linked with the correct
	  OpenSSL libraries.  If not, it errors out.  This prevents later
	  crashes in OpenSSL, due to library incompatibilities.
	* Added radmin command "hup main.log", to re-open the log files,
	  without HUPing any other part of the server.
	* Added support for EAP-Key-Name.  See raddb/sites-available/default,
	  and look for comments mentioning EAP-Key-Name.  MacSec now works.
	* Added support for hex numbers (0x...) to %{expr: ...}
	* Backported TLS client certificate validation from 3.0.0.
	* Run Post-Auth for EAP inner-tunnel methods.
	* Added more RFCs
	* Added "show config <path>" to radmin.  You can now examine any
	  configuration item in a running server.
	* Added TLS-Client-Cert-X509v3-Extended-Key-Usage for TLS-based EAP
	  methods.  It is set automatically from the fields in the certificate.
	* Add CRLCP attribute in certificate creation script.  Windows phones
	  require it.  Patch from Alan Buxey.

	Bug fixes
	* Skip OCSP if there's no host / port / url, with soft_fail
	* Properly decode AT_IDENTITY in EAP-SIM.  Patch from Iliya Peregoudov
	* Thread max_queue_size has better bounds checking.
	* Use correct variable for warning message if the user misconfigures
	  the server.
	* radtest is more generous about parsing ppphint
	* radeapclient now accepts -4 and -6, just like radclient.
	  Patch from John Dennis.
	* Ignore ".rpmnew" and a bunch of other files when loading config
	  files from a directory.
	* Wait for child threads before exiting.  This prevents errors on
	  exit, but may increase exit time if databases are blocked!
	  Patch from Iliya Peregoudov.
	* Wrap rbtree calls in mutexes in rlm_cache to prevent memory
	  corruption. Patch from Phil Mayers.
	* Port fix for %{3GPP-*} expansion from master branch.
	* Fix sample certificate scripts when multiple client certs are
	  made
	* Track return code priorities across if/else/elsif in unlang.
	  Closes #107
	* In debug mode, print out DHCP options when sending a DHCP packet.
	* Fixes to the redis modules from Brian Candler
	* Print better debug message for LDAP "operations error"
	* Fix a number of minor issues as found by Coverity
	* Frees module config in order to prevent occasional crash on exit
	* Update DHCP debugging messages to make it clearer what's
	  going on.
	* Print multiple DHCP options the correct number of times in
	  debugging mode
	* On debug builds, don't dlclose() modules when '-m' is used.
	  This allows valgrind to show module symbols.
	* Don't count Status-Server packets in Access-Request statistics
	* Minor cleanups to debug output
	* Be more careful handling module configurations to avoid crash
	  on otherwise clean exit.
	* For raddebug, correctly set the group of the output file.
	* renamed dhclient to dhcpclient.  People who install it
	  shouldn't have their systems broken.
	* for EAP-TLS methods, random_file is no longer required.
	  OpenSSL already reads /dev/urandom.
	* Fix Suse and Redhat scripts.  Patches from Fajar Nugraha.
	* Minor bug fix for base64 decoding.
	* Allow two consecutive WiMAX TLVs of the same number.
	* Remove requirement that User-Name has to match MS-CHAP-User-Name.
	  I18n issues means that the character sets could be different.
	* Don't use ephemeral thread states from PyGILState_Ensure(), use
	  our own, generated one per thread and stored in TLS.
	* Port module processing fixes from v3.  The code is simpler,
	  and one or two esoteric bugs are now gone.
	* update code handling max_requests_per_server.  It should now
	  work correctly.
	* wrap ASCTIME_R for systems not supporting the standard API.

FreeRADIUS 2.2.0 Mon 10 Sep 2012 12:00:00 CEST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* 100% configuration file compatible with 2.1.x.
	  The only fix needed is to disallow "hashsize=0" for rlm_passwd
	* Update Aruba, Alcatel Lucent, APC, BT, PaloAlto, Pureware,
	  Redback, and Mikrotik dictionaries
	* Switch to using SHA1 for certificate digests instead of MD5.
	  See raddb/certs/*.cnf
	* Added copyright statements to the dictionaries, so that we know
	  when people are using them.
	* Better documentation for radrelay and detail file writer.
	  See raddb/modules/radrelay and raddb/radrelay.conf
	* Added TLS-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Email from patch by Luke Howard

	* Added query timeouts to MySQL driver.  Patch from Brian De Wolf.
	* Add /etc/default/freeradius to debian package.
	  Patch from Matthew Newton
	* Finalize DHCP and DHCP relay code.  It should now work everywhere.
	  See raddb/sites-available/dhcp, src_ipaddr and src_interface.
	* DHCP capabilitiies are now compiled in by default.
	  It runs as a DHCP server ONLY when manually enabled.
	* Added one letter expansions: %G - request minute and %I request
	  ID.
	* Added script to convert ISC DHCP lease files to SQL pools.
	  See scripts/isc2ippool.pl
	* Added rlm_cache to cache arbitrary attributes.
	* Added max_use to rlm_ldap to force connection to be re-established
	  after a given number of queries.
	* Added configtest option to Debian init scripts, and automatic
	  config test on restart.
	* Added cache config item to rlm_krb5. When set to "no" ticket
	  caching is disabled which may increase performance.

	Bug fixes
	* Fix CVE-2012-3547.  All users of 2.1.10, 2.1.11, 2.1.12,
	  and 802.1X should upgrade immediately.
	* Fix typo in detail file writer, to skip writing if the packet
	  was read from this detail file.
	* Free cached replies when closing resumed SSL sessions.
	* Fix a number of issues found by Coverity.
	* Fix memory leak and race condition in the EAP-TLS session cache.
	  Thanks to Phil Mayers for tracking down OpenSSL APIs.
	* Restrict ATTRIBUTE names to character sets that make sense.
	* Fix EAP-TLS session Id length so that OpenSSL doesn't get
	  excited.
	* Fix SQL IPPool logic for non-timer attributes.  Closes bug #181
	* Change some informational messages to DEBUG rather than error.
	* Portability fixes for FreeBSD.  Closes bug #177
	* A much better fix for the _lt__PROGRAM__LTX_preloaded_symbols
	  nonsense.
	* Safely handle extremely long lines in conf file variable expansion
	* Fix for Debian bug #606450
	* Mutex lock around rlm_perl Clone routines. Patch from Eike Dehling
	* The passwd module no longer permits "hashsize = 0".  Setting that
	  is pointless for a host of reasons.  It will also break the server.
	* Fix proxied inner-tunnel packets sometimes having zero authentication
	  vector.  Found by Brian Julin.
	* Added $(EXEEXT) to Makefiles for portability.  Closes bug #188.
	* Fix minor build issue which would cause rlm_eap to be built twice.
	* When using "status_check=request" for a home server, the username
	  and password must be specified, or the server will not start.
	* EAP-SIM now calculates keys from the SIM identity, not from the
	  EAP-Identity.  Changing the EAP type via NAK may result in
	  identities changing.  Bug reported by Microsoft EAP team.
	* Use home server src_ipaddr when sending Status-Server packets
	* Decrypt encrypted ERX attributes in CoA packets.
	* Fix registration of internal xlat's so %{mschap:...} doesn't
	  disappear after a HUP.
	* Can now reference tagged attributes in expansions.
	  e.g. %{Tunnel-Type:1} and %{Tunnel-Type:1[0]} now work.
	* Correct calculation of Message-Authenticator for CoA and Disconnect
	  replies.  Patch from Jouni Malinen
	* Install rad_counter, for managing rlm_counter files.
	* Add unique index constraint to all SQL flavours so that alternate
	  queries work correctly.
	* The TTLS diameter decoder is now more lenient.  It ignores
	  unknown attributes, instead of rejecting the TTLS session.
	* Use "globfree" in detail file reader.  Prevents very slow leak.
	  Closes bug #207.
	* Operator =~ shouldn't copy the attribute, like :=.  It should
	  instead behave more like ==.
	* Build main Debian package without SQL dependencies
	* Use max_queue_size in threading code
	* Update permissions in raddb/sql/postgresql/admin.sql
	* Added OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() to fix issues where OpenSSL
	  wouldn't use methods it knew about.
	* Add more sanity checks in dynamic_clients code so the server won't
	  crash if it attempts to load a badly formated client definition.
